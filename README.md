# RFID-Tag-Door-Lock-System
This is a computer science project that I started in order to build to creating a door lock system specifically for a pet door. The goal was to work my way up to being able to integrate an RFID door lock system with a tag that can be connected to a pet to allow them access through a pet door in order to give them more autonomy when alone.
